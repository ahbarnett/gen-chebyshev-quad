# Generalized Chebyshev Quadrature

author: Alex H. Barnett

A scratch repo for codes for GCQ. Such codes automatically create a 1D quadrature scheme (nodes and weights) that integrate a given family of functions to a prescribed user tolerance.

Directories:

 - ``julia`` for Julia code.
 - ``matlab`` for MATLAB/Octave code
