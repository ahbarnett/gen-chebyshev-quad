MATLAB+Chebfun implementation of generalized Chebyshev quadratures

Make sure chebfun is in your path, then to demo, run test_genchebquad.
For the algorithm, read genchebquad_basic.m or see ../README.md

Quick example:

pows = -0.2:0.4:20;
[x,w] = genchebquad_basic(@(x) x.^pows, [0 1], 1e-12)

returns nodes x and weights w that integrate functions on [0,1] in the span
of the listed power-laws, with 12-digit target tolerance.

Main files:
genchebquad_basic.m  : simple/readable version (worse with strong singularities)
test_genchebquad.m   : tester/demo script for the above
genchebquad_dev.m    : development version, regenerating nodes (more accurate)

Utilities:
rowpivots_chebfun.m  : pivoted LQ decomposition of a chebfun
getquad_chebfun.m    : extract or build quadrature scheme from split chebfun
gauss.m              : Gauss-Legendre quadrature
